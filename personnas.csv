18,Non-GIS BO,Can I customize the reports (both on-screen and printable) myself?,Can the client easily customize reports as either on-screen or printable?,Application Features,,yes,"This is tied to the create reports question.

Plus can I bring in a GIS file that may or may not be officially published,Application Features,Consume and integrate local data into the web mapping application; Transfer data collected within the web mapping application to operational systems,,"Published equals approved format and not just a random AOI using heads up digitizing.  Is integrating local data the same as export/import? What about ""consume and integrate provincial data""? Does ""transfer data to operational systems also relate to this question?"
41,Application owner (widget branch),Can I export an AOI to use in my GIS for advanced analysis,Can I export an AOI to use in my GIS for advanced analysis,Application Features,Download the data being viewed,Partially available,"does ""download data being viewed"" equal ""export AOI""?

The original question was more about the on-map tools available for ease of use (i.e. measure distance, area, draw polygons, compare them, etc). I think that the requirement answers this, just not in detail?"
23,Non-GIS BO,"Is map easy to navigate?

37,Application owner (widget branch),Can I provide an easy way for my clients to manage their widgets,Can I provide an easy way for my clients to manage their interests?,Application Features,,,There's probably an underlying assumption here that I don't understand. Is this a request for some specific feature? Would be good to see examples. No information about that though.
38,Application owner (widget branch),Can I print a map,Can I print a map,Application Features,,,"Print as in physically print feature? Meaning print what I see? Or generate a printable report with a map? Anyway, no answer to this question either"

44,Application owner (widget branch),Can I turn on or off layers from the BCGW,Can I turn on or off layers from the BCGW?,Application Features,,,"Is this like in Explore by Location where one can turn off layers to display more/less info, but only with BCGW layers? No answer to this question."
45,Application owner (widget branch),Can I be informed about changes to the layers within my AOI,Can I be informed about changes to specific interests that are within my AOI?,Application Features,,,"So, is this like a notification feature that tracks changes over time and notifies when any of them affect your AOI?
